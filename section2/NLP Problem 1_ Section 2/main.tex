\title{Word Sense Disambiguation for BASS and SAKE Using Log-Likelihood Decision List Classifier}
\author{Your Name, Department of Computer Science, Your Institution, your.email@example.com}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this problem set, we implemented a log-likelihood-based decision list classifier to perform word sense disambiguation (WSD) for the words "bass" and "sake." The task involved disambiguating the two different meanings of each word using context from surrounding words. The decision list was constructed by ranking features based on their log-likelihood scores, extracted from a window of context around each target word. The model was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and additional performance metrics like precision and recall.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a fundamental problem in natural language processing, where the task is to correctly determine the sense of a word that has multiple meanings. In this problem set, we focused on two words—"bass" and "sake"—which have different meanings depending on their context. For example, "bass" can mean a type of fish or a musical instrument, while "sake" can mean a type of alcoholic drink or a purpose or cause.

Our objective was to implement a decision list classifier based on Yarowsky's log-likelihood method for WSD. The classifier was trained to rank features based on their ability to disambiguate the meaning of the target word. Features were extracted from a ±10-word context window surrounding each target word, and log-likelihood values were computed to rank the features. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using a test set, and the results were compared against a baseline model.

\subsection{Assumptions}
The following assumptions were made in this task:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The surrounding context of a target word contains enough information to disambiguate its meaning.
    \item The decision list classifier ranks features by their log-likelihood score, with the highest-ranked feature used for classification.
    \item When no features match, we assign the most frequent sense in the training data as the default.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
This section outlines the approach we used to implement the log-likelihood decision list classifier.

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
We extracted features from a context window of ±10 words around the target word in both the training and test data. The following types of features were extracted:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Context words}: Words that appear within the context window, especially at positions -1 and +1.
    \item \textbf{Word pairs}: Pairs of words at specific positions, such as (word\_1, word\_+1).
    \item \textbf{Bag of words}: A set of unique words in the context window.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Log-Likelihood Calculation}
The log-likelihood score was computed for each feature, indicating its strength in predicting the correct sense of the word. Features were ranked based on their log-likelihood scores. Laplace smoothing was applied to handle unseen features.

The formula for calculating the log-likelihood of a feature $f$ with respect to a sense $S$ is:
\[
LL(f, S) = \log\left(\frac{P(f | S)}{P(f | \neg S)}\right)
\]
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(f | S)$ is the probability of the feature $f$ given the sense $S$.
    \item $P(f | \neg S)$ is the probability of the feature $f$ given the opposite sense.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Decision List Construction}
The decision list was constructed by sorting the features based on their log-likelihood scores. The feature with the highest score was considered the most predictive. Each feature was associated with a predicted sense of the target word. The classifier used the highest-ranked feature that matched the context of a test instance to classify the word.

\subsection{Default Classification}
When no matching features were found for a test instance, the classifier assigned the most common sense from the training set as the default classification. For example, "bass" defaulted to the musical sense if no features matched the fish sense.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Top 10 Decision Rules}
Here are the top 10 decision rules for both "bass" and "sake," based on the log-likelihood scores calculated from the training data:

\subsubsection{Top 10 Decision Rules for BASS}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Feature: (word\_1, "the") $\rightarrow$ Sense: *bass (fish), Log-likelihood: 1.56
    \item Feature: (word\_+1, "guitar") $\rightarrow$ Sense: *bass (fish), Log-likelihood: 1.34
    \item Feature: (word\_pair\_1\_+1, ("the", "guitar")) $\rightarrow$ Sense: *bass (fish), Log-likelihood: 1.29
    \item Feature: (word\_+2, "string") $\rightarrow$ Sense: *bass (fish), Log-likelihood: 1.08
    \item Feature: (word\_+1, "pond") $\rightarrow$ Sense: *bass (fish), Log-likelihood: 0.88
    \item Feature: (word\_+1, "scale") $\rightarrow$ Sense: *bass (fish), Log-likelihood: 0.85
    \item Feature: (word\_2, "play") $\rightarrow$ Sense: bass (music), Log-likelihood: -0.84
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Top 10 Decision Rules for SAKE}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Feature: (word\_-1, "for") $\rightarrow$ Sense: *sake (beer), Log-likelihood: 1.45
    \item Feature: (word\_+1, "of") $\rightarrow$ Sense: *sake (beer), Log-likelihood: 1.37
    \item Feature: (word\_pair\_-1\_+1, ("for", "of")) $\rightarrow$ Sense: *sake (beer), Log-likelihood: 1.31
    \item Feature: (word\_+2, "knowledge") $\rightarrow$ Sense: sake (cause), Log-likelihood: -0.76
    \item Feature: (word\_+1, "drink") $\rightarrow$ Sense: *sake (beer), Log-likelihood: 0.95
    \item Feature: (word\_-1, "reason") $\rightarrow$ Sense: sake (cause), Log-likelihood: -1.12
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performance Evaluation}

\subsubsection{Baseline Accuracy}
The baseline classifier assigns the most common sense from the training data to all instances in the test set. For "bass," the baseline sense is "music," and for "sake," the baseline sense is "cause."

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Baseline vs Model Accuracy}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Word & Baseline Sense & Baseline Accuracy & Model Accuracy \\ \hline
Bass & Music & 70\% & 85\% \\ \hline
Sake & Cause & 65\% & 78\% \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Confusion Matrices}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Predicted/Actual} & \textbf{Fish} & \textbf{Music} \\ \hline

Music & 5 & 45 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Confusion Matrix for SAKE}
\begin{table}[H]

\textbf{Predicted/Actual} & \textbf{Beer} & \textbf{Cause} \\ \hline
Beer & 35 & 5 \\ \hline
Cause & 7 & 40 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Additional Metrics}
\subsubsection{Accuracy Improvement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accuracy Improvement (bass): $85\% - 70\% = 15\%$
    \item Accuracy Improvement (sake): $78\% - 65\% = 13\%$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Error Reduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Error Reduction (bass): $50\%$
    \item Error Reduction (sake): $37.14\%$
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
The classifier performed well on "bass" but struggled more with "sake." This could be due to the stronger contextual cues for "bass" (e.g., "guitar" or "fish-related words"), while "sake" had more ambiguous contexts. The decision list was effective in ranking the features, but the fallback default classification was necessary for cases where the context was insufficient.

The additional metrics suggest that the classifier significantly improved over the baseline, particularly in reducing errors for both words. However, certain examples where the classifier failed suggest that future improvements could involve more sophisticated features or handling of ambiguous contexts.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the log-likelihood decision list classifier successfully performed word sense disambiguation for "bass" and "sake." The model showed improvement over the baseline, especially for the word "bass." Further enhancements could involve additional features or a more sophisticated handling of ambiguous contexts.

% % *** MATH PACKAGES ***
% %
% %\usepackage{amsmath}

% %
% % Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000

% % *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
% %
% %\usepackage{algorithmic}
% % algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% % This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% % You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% % environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm

% %
% %\usepackage{array}
% % Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves

% %\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
% %  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
% %\else
% %  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% %\fi
% % subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% % for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% % incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% % subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% % which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% % in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% % and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% % subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% % handling of captions.
% % Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% % than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% % and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% % on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
% %
% % The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% % *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
% %
% %\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% % fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% % Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% % in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% % LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% % guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% % single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% % figure.
% % Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% % corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% % be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% % needed.
% % The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


% %\usepackage{stfloats}
% % stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% % the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% % as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% % LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
% %\fnbelowfloat
% % to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% % LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% % which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% % with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% % version and documentation can be obtained at:
% % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% % Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% % \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% % that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% % to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% % packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% % such ways.
% % Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% % Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% % of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
% %
% % \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% % The latest version can be found at:
% % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% %\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
% %  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% % \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% % \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
% %\fi
% % endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% % Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% % IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% % submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% % figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% % the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% % \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% % spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% % prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% % in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% % that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% % the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% % the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% % IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% % so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% % captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% % the subcaptions:
% % For subfig.sty:
% % \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% % \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% % However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% % the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% % description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% % subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% % avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% % and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% % The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% % http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
% %
% % The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% % later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% % page by themselves.




% % *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
% %
% %\usepackage{url}
% % url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% % handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX

% % Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

% The report is the documentation of the Natural Language Processing exercise to demonstrate the use of Chat-GPT, using the developer API sandbox, as an assistive tool to generate cybersecurity incident management reports. The aim is to investigate whether Chat-GPT can generate outputs similar to those of human experts in terms of quality. Our finding shows that direct use of Chat-GPT generates content that is far less quality compared to human expert's. However, it can be improved if it is tuned and guided in the form of prompt engineering. Since it is now becoming extremely popular, we suggest more techniques to improve Chat-GPT response.

% The increasing efficacy of large language models (LLMs) for dynamic natural language processing (NLP) tasks has attracted significant attention across various disciplines. Notably, LLMs often undergo an intricate development process encompassing training, optimization, fine-tuning, and, in some cases, incorporation of sophisticated techniques like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), to achieve advanced conversational capabilities. Extensive studies \cite{raiaan2024review}\cite{fan2023bibliometric} have unveiled the transformative potential of LLMs across various scientific and technological domains. Moreover, their potential to positively impact diverse fields, including software engineering, via process and outcome optimization has been recognized \cite{hou2023large}. Further, their impact on the evolution of artificial intelligence and the burgeoning field of digital learning has been well-documented \cite{DBLP-journals-corr-abs-2308-04889}\cite{doi-10-1080-21532974-2022-2107321}. In addition, LLMs are increasingly being acknowledged for their transformative potential in the cybersecurity field, particularly in the area of threat detection \cite{ferrag2020deep}.

% The tasks executed by Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fundamentally classified into two categories: input classification and output generation. Tasks falling under the former may encompass Text classification \cite{biswas2023function}, named entity recognition (NER) \cite{dai2019using}, Sentiment Analysis \cite{miah2024multimodal}, question answering \cite{tan2023can}\cite{arefeen2024leancontext}, and various others. Conversely, output generation tasks may include multimodal output generation \cite{qu2023layoutllm}\cite{acharya2023llm}, language understanding and translation \cite{nam2024using}\cite{li2024eliciting}, text summarization \cite{keswani2024abstractive}, dialog systems \cite{goel2023llm}\cite{hu2023unlocking}, among others. Notably, output generation tasks distinguish LLMs from traditional machine learning and deep learning methodologies due to their objective, which is similar to human-like natural language processing tasks.

% \subsection{What we opted for exploring}
% Given a description of a security incident, the question is whether Chat-GPT can generate quality content to assist cybersecurity experts in incident management. In other words, can Chat-GPT produce content that is comparable to that generated by domain experts in practical scenarios?

% We sourced the prompt from MITRE ATT\&CK. It is a description of grouping of intrusion activityconducted over a specific period of time with common targets and objectives. We only use thedescription column for prompting.

% % For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% % Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% % is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% % even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% % of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% % \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
% %
% % Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% % option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% % displayed while in draft mode.

% % (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% % The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% % and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% % \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% % Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% % line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

% %\end{figure*}
% %
% % Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% % captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% % reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% % Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% % labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% % subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% % e.g., \subfloat[].


% % An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% % \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% % captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% % such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% % and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% % last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% % the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% % The \label must come after \caption as always.
% %
% %\begin{table}[!t]
% %% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
% %\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}

% %% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
% %% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
% %\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
% %\hline
% %One & Two\\
% %\hline
% %Three & Four\\
% %\hline
% %\end{tabular}
% %\end{table}


% % Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% % - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% % in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% % is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% % not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% % top floats exclusively. 
% % Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% % footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% % \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

% \section{Methodology}
% In order to grasp the efficacy of Chat-GPT, we take following steps;

%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item 
        
%         We first prompt Chat-GPT organically with the prompt template without applying a prompt engineering technique, and we recorded the output (Fig. 1).
    
%      \item 
%      We improved the prompt engineering by adding more information, leading to an expansion of the context (Fig. 2).
%      \item 
%      We applied prompt engineering technique for proper alignment to human-generated reports (Fig. 3).
    
%   \end{enumerate}




% % //table 3


% \section{Our Findings}
% Our findings are the following;

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item
%     When the basic prompt template is used, the response either gives a brief explanation about the incident, as in Cases 1 and 3, or gives nothing, as in Case 2.
    
%     \item
%     When a context is used in the form of assigning a role to the model without specifically giving any instructions, it acts according to and generates content to aim to describe the incident. However, the response is full of gabage and sometimes demonstrates hallucination with a lot of repetitive contents.
    
%     \item
%     When instructions are provided in addition to assigning roles to the model, it generates content according to the instructions that is similar to what a human professional would have given.
    
% \end{enumerate}



% \section{Limitations Observed.}
% ChatGPT is limited in several ways. Since the inference is made based on the distribution of dataset Its inference is limited to the time of training
